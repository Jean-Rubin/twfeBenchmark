# twfeBenchmark

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of twfeBenchmark is to provide an exploration tool for understanding
two-way fixed effect estimations.

## Example

You can clone the project, and run:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
devtools::load_all() # this should load all the functions inside the project
twfeBenchmark::run_twfe_app() # This will launch the Shiny App
```

This should launch a Shiny application and open an interactive window.
